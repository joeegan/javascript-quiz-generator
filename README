#description 
prototype of a javascript quiz with 'dynamic' questions

#considerations
* question builder could use 'slots' of an array to store constructs in, rather than a long string concatenation
* there is going to need to be a 'rules' concept regarding how each type of construct is allowed to fill the slots
    - this is likely to be the most consuming part of the project, what can make this more achievable?
    - ECMAScript specification 
    - limited use of constructs, gradually build
    - testing is going to be essential
* the question should be rejected if it fails (try, catch?) though ideally only 'valid' questions are generated
